🛡️ Vulnerability Scope Validator
Defensive Exposure Drift & Patch Validation Tool
🚀 Core Features
🔍 1. Automated TCP SYN Scanning

Executes Nmap using:

-Pn (skip host discovery)

-sS (TCP SYN stealth scan)

-p 20-1024 (critical service port range)

Generates structured XML output per target.

Uses secure subprocess execution (no shell=True).

📄 2. Structured XML Parsing

Parses Nmap XML output using xml.etree.ElementTree.

Extracts:

Open TCP ports

Host-level scan data

Converts raw scan results into structured Python objects for comparison.

🗂 3. Multi-Host Baseline Management

Maintains a single baseline.json file.

Tracks exposure per host independently.

Supports unlimited hosts over time.

Automatically adds new hosts when first scanned.

🔄 4. Automatic Baseline Migration

Detects legacy single-host baseline format.

Automatically converts to multi-host schema.

Maintains backward compatibility.

Prevents runtime failures due to schema changes.

🕒 5. Per-Host Baseline Timestamping

Stores last_baseline_update per host.

Allows defenders to verify:

When exposure state was last trusted.

Whether comparison is valid for patch validation.

⚖️ 6. Exposure Drift Detection (Core Capability)

Compares:

Stored baseline ports

Current scan ports

Identifies:

Newly opened ports

Closed ports

Unchanged ports

This enables:

Patch validation

Configuration drift detection

Unexpected exposure detection

🧠 7. Patch Cycle Validation Workflow

Supports two operational modes:

Baseline Mode

Used before patch cycle.

Establishes or updates trusted exposure state.

Compare Mode

Used after remediation.

Validates whether exposure changed as expected.

🆕 8. Automatic New Host Handling

If a scanned host:

Does not exist in baseline

The tool:

Automatically adds it

Prevents comparison failure

Maintains data consistency

🧱 9. Schema Validation & Fault Tolerance

Detects corrupted or unknown baseline formats.

Safely resets or migrates data structures.

Prevents crashes due to malformed JSON.

🛡 10. Defensive Engineering Practices Applied

Secure subprocess execution

Structured JSON storage

Set-based comparison logic

Port deduplication

Per-host isolation

XML-based structured parsing

Input handling and validation

Drift detection logic
